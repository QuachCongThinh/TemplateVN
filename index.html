    <div id="geography">
        <img src="./img/VietnamOMC.png" alt="">
        <p>Vietnam is a tropical country with mostly mountainous terrain (accounting for 3/4 of the territory), mainly
            low hills, and plains accounting for only 1/4 of the area. Across the country, plain terrain and low
            mountains (under 1,000 m) account for 85% of the area. High mountain terrain (over 2,000 m) accounts for
            only 1% of the country's area. The topographical structure is quite diverse thanks to the rejuvenation of
            the Neo-tectonic movement, creating a clear gradation by altitude, descending from the northwest to the
            southeast. Land that can be used for agriculture accounts for less than 20%. The country is divided into
            mountainous areas and the Red River Delta in the north; Truong Son range, Central Highlands, central coastal
            plain, and Mekong Delta in the south.</p>

                <h2>Vietnamese Heritage</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>- The whole country has more than 40,000 relics and landscapes, of which more than 3,000 relics are
                    ranked national relics, 5,000 relics are ranked provincial level. The Red River Delta is the area
                    with the highest density and number of relics, up to 70%. In addition, nationwide, Vietnam also has
                    117 museums - places that preserve the nation's heroic history.
                    <br />
                    - Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world that has so many heritage sites recognized by
                    UNESCO. Up to now, our country has 8 heritage sites recognized by UNESCO: Thang Long Imperial
                    Citadel, Hoi An ancient town, Trang An scenic complex, Hue ancient capital, Ho Dynasty citadel, My
                    Son sanctuary, national park. Phong Nha - Ke Bang area, Ha Long Bay. This is one of Vietnam's
                    tourism potentials to attract international visitors.

                <h2>Scenic spots</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>- Vietnam has been recognized by UNESCO as 8 world biosphere reserves, including: Red River Delta, Cat
                    Ba, Tay Nghe An, Dong Nai, Cu Lao Cham, Can Gio, Ca Mau and Kien Giang Sea. It can be said that our
                    country has both "golden forests and silver seas". Not only is it strong in the potential for
                    developing Vietnam's marine tourism, but the plains, mountains and midlands of our country also
                    possess countless "memorable" landscapes for tourists.
                    <br />
                    - The potential for developing Vietnam's beach tourism is most clearly demonstrated in the summer -
                    the time when the need for cool bathing increases. Meanwhile, autumn - winter and spring in
                    mountainous areas such as the Northwest and Central Highlands attract diners because of the flower
                    seasons and the romantic, poetic atmosphere. Some beautiful places to visit in the mountainous
                    provinces in Vietnam: Moc Chau in the season of mustard flowers and plum blossoms, Da Lat with pink
                    grass hills in early winter, the Northwest in ripe rice season, Gia Lai in the season of bright
                    yellow cassia flowers...

                <h2>Culture and Cuisine</h2>
                <p>- Culture and Cuisine are two of the tourism potentials that need to be preserved and developed.
                    Vietnam has 54 ethnic groups, each region and each ethnic group has its own cultural identity,
                    customs, and lifestyle, creating its own charm. Not only that, Vietnam also has famous intangible
                    cultural heritage: Hue royal court music, Central Highlands gong cultural space, ca tru, quan ho,
                    Xoan singing, Giong festival, Hung worshiping beliefs. Vuong (March 10 of the lunar calendar)... to
                    attract tourists.
                    <br />
                    - Thanks to the diversity in national culture, the cuisine in our country is equally rich. Vietnam was
                    honored to be in the Top 15 countries with the most attractive street food in the world. Some
                    Vietnamese dishes are loved by international friends such as: Pho, banh mi, Hue beef noodle soup..
